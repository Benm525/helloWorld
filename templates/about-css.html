    <h1> Benjamin McDonald  </h1>
        <p>
            My name is Benjamin McDonald. I am from Midland Park, New Jersey.
            I am a Finance and Information Systems <strong> double major </strong>.
            I am also a senior, and I am <strong> very </strong> excited to graduate and start working.
            I currently do not have a job, but I am actively searching for one near my hometown.
        </p>

    <h2> Fun Facts </h2>
        <p>
            I enjoy working out, playing basketball, and hanging out with my friends.
            I <em> love </em> to go fishing. I will fish anywhere from local ponds to out at sea.
            I also <em> really </em> enjoy baking. My favorite thing to bake is either chocolate chip or oreo cheesecake cookies.
        </p>

        <p id="special-paragraph">
            Some more fun facts about me are that I am a twin and am one of 4 children. My twin brother's name is Paul; he is 4 minutes
            older than me. I also have a younger brother named Jesse and a younger sister names Sydney.
